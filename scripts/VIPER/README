This includes the implememtation for VIPER, an algorithm that operates on 
RNA-Seq and Microarray data and is implemented in R. It uses the Dockerized 
version, which must be installed: see the test scripts here to run a single
sample against a background of TCGA normals. 

Also included are scripts for a python implementation written by Evan Paull
and stored in the 'TieDIE.Private/bin/masterReg' github repository. 
For reference, a data matrix of PRAD TCGA normals are stored here. RSEM
normalized values (the 'scaled_estimate' field in the GDAC/TCGA data files) are
multiplied by 1e6 to get Transcripts Per Million (TPM) values, which are comparable
across samples. Scripts to both create the null distribution from TCGA data
as well as to run a new sample against the summary statistics generated from the null are 
here.
